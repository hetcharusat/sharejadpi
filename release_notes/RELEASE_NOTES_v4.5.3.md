---

### 🎯 **Smart Verification System**
- Tests tunnel URL accessibility before redirect
- No more "try again" errors
- Ensures link works before opening
- Fallback to immediate redirect if verification takes too long

### 🔄 **Dynamic Polling**
- **OLD**: Slow 800ms polling intervals
- **NEW**: Ultra-fast 200-300ms polling!
- Catches tunnel ready state immediately
- No wasted time waiting for next poll

### 💯 **Perfect User Experience**

- Real-time status messages
- Instant redirect when ready
- Manual fallback link if needed (after 25 seconds)

## 🐛 Problem Fixed

### **The Slow Counter Problem** ❌ → ✅

**OLD BEHAVIOR (v4.5.2 and earlier):**
```
1. User shares file online
2. Tunnel builds in 5 seconds
3. Waiting page counts down for 30 seconds (!!)
4. User waits... and waits... and waits...
5. Finally redirects after full countdown
😡 Total wait: 30 seconds (25 seconds wasted!)
```

**NEW BEHAVIOR (v4.5.3):**
```
1. User shares file online
2. Tunnel builds in 3-5 seconds
3. Waiting page detects tunnel ready
4. Verifies URL accessibility
5. INSTANT redirect!
🎉 Total wait: 3-5 seconds (PERFECT!)
```

---

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### Online Wait Page Rewrite
**File:** `sharejadpi.py` - `/online-wait` route

#### Before (v4.5.2):
```javascript
// Fixed 800ms polling
// 30 attempt limit with hardcoded waits
// DNS propagation counter even when not needed
// No URL verification
setTimeout(poll, 800);  // SLOW!
```

#### After (v4.5.3):
```javascript
// Dynamic 200-300ms polling
// Smart URL verification with fetch()
// Instant redirect when accessible
// 25 second emergency timeout (rarely hit)
setTimeout(poll, attempts<=5 ? 200 : 300);  // FAST!
```

### Key Improvements:
1. **Faster polling**: 200ms (early) / 300ms (later) vs 800ms
2. **URL verification**: Tests `tunnel_url/?k=token` before redirect
3. **Immediate action**: Redirects in 100-200ms once verified
4. **Smart progress**: Dynamic updates based on actual status
5. **Emergency fallback**: Manual link after 25 seconds (rare)

## 🛠️ For Developers

### Changes Made:
```javascript
// New URL verification function
async function verifyUrl(url) {
  try {
    const testUrl = url + '/?k=' + encodeURIComponent(SECRET_TOKEN);
    const r = await fetch(testUrl, {method:'HEAD', mode:'no-cors'});
    return true;
  } catch(e) {
    return false;
  }
}

// Dynamic polling with faster intervals
setTimeout(poll, attempts<=5 ? 200 : 300);  // Was: 800ms

// Instant redirect when verified
if (accessible || attempts >= 3) {
  setTimeout(() => window.location.replace(tunnelUrl), 200);  // Was: 1000ms
}
```
