# ShareJadPi v4.5.0 - Release Notes
**Release Date:** October 17, 2025

## üéØ Overview
Version 4.5.0 is a **critical bug fix release** that resolves major issues preventing online sharing from working in production builds. This version ensures the Cloudflare tunnel feature works reliably in the installed Windows executable.

---

## üêõ Critical Bugs Fixed

### 1. **Windowless EXE Crash (sys.stdout.flush)**
**Impact:** Online sharing completely broken in installed EXE  
**Symptoms:**
- `/api/tunnel/start` returned 500 Internal Server Error
- Tunnel never started when triggered from installed application
- Error message: `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'flush'`

**Root Cause:**
- PyInstaller builds with `console=False` (windowless mode) set `sys.stdout` to `None`
- Code contained 18 instances of `sys.stdout.flush()` which crashed immediately
- Crashes occurred before any logging could happen, making debugging difficult

**Fix:**
- Created `_safe_flush()` helper function that checks if stdout exists before flushing
- Replaced all `sys.stdout.flush()` calls with safe wrapper
- Online sharing now works in windowless builds

---

### 2. **Waiting Page Stuck at DNS Verification**
**Impact:** Users saw "Verifying DNS Propagation" indefinitely even when tunnel was ready  
**Symptoms:**
- Waiting page showed "Attempt 6/30, 7/30..." continuously
- Never redirected to the public tunnel URL
- Manual testing showed tunnel was active and working

**Root Cause:**
- JavaScript only redirected when `reachable: true`
- Reachability check (HEAD request to tunnel URL) often failed due to DNS propagation delay
- 5-second timeout was too short for Cloudflare's global DNS updates

**Fix:**
- Modified `/online-wait` page to redirect after 15 polling attempts (~12 seconds) even if `reachable: false`
- Increased HEAD request timeout from 5s to 10s in `/api/tunnel/status`
- Users now see tunnel URL within 12-15 seconds instead of waiting indefinitely

---

### 3. **Cloudflared Path Resolution (Secondary)**
**Impact:** Potential tunnel failures if PyInstaller extraction behaves unexpectedly  
**Fix:**
- Added fallback path checks:
  1. First: `sys._MEIPASS` (PyInstaller temp extraction)
  2. Fallback: Install directory (`C:\Program Files\ShareJadPi`)
  3. Fallback: Script directory (development mode)
- Enhanced debug logging to `%TEMP%\ShareJadPi.log` for troubleshooting

---

## ‚ú® What Works Now

‚úÖ **Online Sharing via Tray Menu**
- "Open Share Page (Online)" opens waiting page and starts tunnel
- Redirects to public URL automatically after ~12 seconds

‚úÖ **Context Menu Integration**
- Right-click file/folder ‚Üí "Share with ShareJadPi (Online)" works
- File-specific tunnels start correctly

‚úÖ **CLI Commands**
- `ShareJadPi-4.5.0.exe view-online` opens waiting page
- `ShareJadPi-4.5.0.exe open-online "file.txt"` shares specific file

‚úÖ **Auto-Server Start**
- Server launches automatically in background when needed
- No blocking prompts or user intervention required

‚úÖ **Debug Logging**
- All tunnel operations logged to `%TEMP%\ShareJadPi.log`
- Cloudflared output captured with `[CF]` prefix

## üì¶ Technical Details

### Files Modified:
- `sharejadpi.py`:
  - Added `_safe_flush()` helper (line 31-38)
  - Updated `/online-wait` JavaScript polling logic (line 2347-2357)
  - Increased reachability timeout to 10s (line 2243)
  - Enhanced cloudflared path fallback logic (lines 147-173)

### Build Artifacts:
- **EXE:** `dist\ShareJadPi-4.5.0.exe` (36.65 MB)
- **Installer:** `installer_output\ShareJadPi-4.5.0-Setup.exe` (50.92 MB)

### New Spec/Installer Files:
- `build_tools\ShareJadPi-4.5.0.spec`
- `build_tools\ShareJadPi-Installer-4.5.0.iss`

---

## üîç Testing Performed

1. ‚úÖ Fresh install via `ShareJadPi-4.5.0-Setup.exe`
2. ‚úÖ Verified `cloudflared.exe` copied to install directory
3. ‚úÖ Tested `view-online` command from installed EXE
4. ‚úÖ Confirmed tunnel starts within 5-10 seconds
5. ‚úÖ Verified `/api/tunnel/status` returns correct data
6. ‚úÖ Tested waiting page redirects after 12-15 seconds
7. ‚úÖ Checked debug log contains cloudflared output

---

## üìã Known Issues (None Critical)

- **DNS Propagation Delay:** First tunnel creation may take 10-15 seconds for global DNS to propagate
  - *Expected behavior* - Cloudflare's free tier has no uptime guarantee
  - Waiting page now handles this gracefully

- **HEAD Request Failures:** Reachability check may still return false even when tunnel is working
  - *Does not block access* - users are redirected regardless after 15 attempts

---

## üöÄ Upgrade Instructions

### For New Installations:
1. Download `ShareJadPi-4.5.0-Setup.exe`
2. Run installer (requires admin for firewall rules)
3. Choose optional features:

## üîß For Developers

### Building from Source:
```powershell
# Build EXE
.\build.ps1

# Build Installer (requires Inno Setup 6)
.\build_installer.ps1
```

### Debug Online Sharing Issues:
1. Enable debug logging: Check `%TEMP%\ShareJadPi.log`
2. Test tunnel manually:
   ```powershell
   Invoke-RestMethod http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/tunnel/start -Method Post -Body '{"size_hint":0}' -ContentType "application/json"
   Invoke-RestMethod http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/tunnel/status
   ```
3. Verify cloudflared bundled:
   ```powershell
   Test-Path "C:\Program Files\ShareJadPi\cloudflared.exe"
   ```
